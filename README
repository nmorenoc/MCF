Introduction:
Multiscale complex fluids simulation (MCF)
has implemeted an Lagrangian mesh-free numerical scheme,
which is smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD),
under a MPI-based parallel framework
named parallel particle-mesh library (PPM).

SDPD method:
SDPD is an extension of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH),
which is a Lagrangian solver for continuum equations, 
such as Navier-Stokes equations.
SDPD cast SPH into GENERIC framework and
introduced thermal fluctuations in a consistent way,
which satisfies dissipation-fluctuation theorem.
The resulted form of SDPD has a similiar structure
as another mesoscopic method, 
dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).
Therefore, SDPD is considered as a multiscale framework
combining SPH and DPD.

PPM:
It is a parallel particle-mesh library developed
at CSElab of ETH Zurich.
PPM is constructued based on 
message passing interface (MPI) routines and
covers many communication requirements for
a typical particle method,
such as SPH, DPD, molecular dynamics (MD).


MCF:
It is kind of client software,
which calls PPM regularly to handle communication 
between processors.
All the physics or numerical parts are done
in this client for a fluid simulation.
